In 1762, on New Year's Eve of the renwu year (the 27th year of the Qianlong reign), he passed away “before reaching the age of fifty, his tears exhausted while the book remained unfinished.” Our understanding of his short life and his incomplete *Dream of the Red Chamber* is often fragmentary, as if his very existence were a riddle.\n\nYet the novel’s unfinished state has never diminished its allure. If anything, its open-endedness inspired generations of readers, giving rise to numerous editions, commentaries, and pictorial interpretations such as this illustrated work.",

Incense is burned not only in grand ceremonies, but also during the Jia household’s daily routines. When the Imperial Consort Yuanchun returns home for her ceremonial visit, lilies are burned in great braziers throughout the Grand View Garden. At family banquets, the Jia clan sets out the elegant trio of censer, vase, and box on the table, using them to burn the imperial “Lily Palace Incense.”\n\nThis set of three—censer, incense box, and utensil vase—forms a complete ensemble. The censer is used for burning incense; the box stores incense; and the vase holds tools such as tongs and scoops. Arranged with the censer in the center and the box and vase to either side, the censer takes pride of place. The censer mentioned in the novel, known as the *Wenwang ding*, derives from bronze ritual vessels used in ceremonies honoring King Wen of Zhou. Frequently imitated in the Ming and Qing periods, such archaistic pieces were treasured as refined objects suited to the contemplative atmosphere of the scholar’s studio.",

Incense is burned not only in grand ceremonies, but also during the Jia household’s daily routines. When the Imperial Consort Yuanchun returns home for her ceremonial visit, lilies are burned in great braziers throughout the Grand View Garden. At family banquets, the Jia clan sets out the elegant trio of censer, vase, and box on the table, using them to burn the imperial “Lily Palace Incense.”\n\nThis set of three—censer, incense box, and utensil vase—forms a complete ensemble. The censer is used for burning incense; the box stores incense; and the vase holds tools such as tongs and scoops. Arranged with the censer in the center and the box and vase to either side, the censer takes pride of place. The censer mentioned in the novel, known as the *Wenwang ding*, derives from bronze ritual vessels used in ceremonies honoring King Wen of Zhou. Frequently imitated in the Ming and Qing periods, such archaistic pieces were treasured as refined objects suited to the contemplative atmosphere of the scholar’s studio.",

Encircled by radiant sunburst ornamentation, the face is protected beneath an oval glass cover. The oval case itself is bordered with petal-like motifs, while the top is embellished with a quiver of arrows, a torch, and fluttering ribbons—classical symbols of enlightenment and refined taste.\n\nBelow, scrolling acanthus leaves support the clock, which stands on a two-tiered base: the upper platform rests on four eagle-shaped feet, and the lower tier is adorned with floral designs. On the reverse appears the inscription “Willm Carpenter London,” along with a scale regulating speed—“FASTER,” “1–9,” “SLOWER.” Two original winding keys accompany the piece.\n\nElegant, intricate, and richly symbolic, the clock reflects the craftsmanship and decorative vocabulary of late eighteenth-century London, embodying both precision timekeeping and the aesthetic ideals of its age.",

On the reverse appears the inscription “Willm Carpenter London,” along with a scale regulating speed—“FASTER,” “1–9,” “SLOWER.” Two original winding keys accompany the piece.\n\nElegant, intricate, and richly symbolic, the clock reflects the craftsmanship and decorative vocabulary of late eighteenth-century London, embodying both precision timekeeping and the aesthetic ideals of its age.",

On its underside remain both the Sèvres factory marks and an original retail label, preserving the story of how it was made, sold, and eventually carried across continents.\n\nAt the center of its marks is the pair of crossed “L”s, the emblem used by the Sèvres manufactory in honor of the French kings Louis XIV and Louis XV. Inside the intertwined letters appears a small double “f,” a date letter indicating the year of manufacture. By comparing this mark to factory records, the bowl can be firmly dated to 1783—placing it within the reign of Louis XV, as the crossed “L”s here suggest.\n\nIn its early years Sèvres could produce only soft-paste porcelain, but by the 1770s the factory had finally mastered hard-paste—considered in Europe the equal of prized Chinese porcelain. The gilded crown painted above the mark is the factory’s proud signifier of true hard-paste ware. The initials “LF” at the bottom identify the decorator, the skilled painter La France, who in the spring of 1783 embellished not only this bowl but also matching teapots, milk jugs, and cups with the same refined motifs.\n\nDuring the latter half of the eighteenth century, Sèvres was overseen by France’s prime minister, Henry Leonard Jean-Baptiste Bertin, a statesman deeply fascinated by distant China. Hoping to express goodwill toward the Qianlong Emperor, Bertin purchased this sugar bowl for 18 livres and arranged for it to be delivered across great distance to the Qing court. The surviving retail label—still legible today—quietly preserves this once-forgotten story of diplomacy, craftsmanship, and the global travels of a single porcelain piece.",

Both the lid and the box are framed with gilt scrolling acanthus designs, within which slices of moss agate are set like miniature picture panels. At the hinge, silver mounts blossom into tiny leaves set with diamonds, rubies, and emeralds, adding a sparkling flourish to the opening gesture.\n\nThe underside is similarly framed with gilt decoration and inset with two agate plaques, each concealing an intimate erotic scene—a hidden luxury common in refined snuffboxes of the period. Comparable to another piece in the Museum attributed to James Cox, this box reflects the exquisite craftsmanship of late eighteenth-century England, where mechanical ingenuity and ornamental artistry often met in objects meant to be held, admired, and treasured.",

Both the lid and the box are framed with gilt scrolling acanthus designs, within which slices of moss agate are set like miniature picture panels. At the hinge, silver mounts blossom into tiny leaves set with diamonds, rubies, and emeralds, adding a sparkling flourish to the opening gesture.\n\nThe underside is similarly framed with gilt decoration and inset with two agate plaques, each concealing an intimate erotic scene—a hidden luxury common in refined snuffboxes of the period. Comparable to another piece in the Museum attributed to James Cox, this box reflects the exquisite craftsmanship of late eighteenth-century England, where mechanical ingenuity and ornamental artistry often met in objects meant to be held, admired, and treasured.",
