        "description": "NPM collection no. 4837\nHeight: 16 cm; Base diameter: 4.8 cm\n\nYuanfei, whose formal name is Jia Yuanchun, is the elder sister of Jia Baoyu. Entering the palace at the age of thirteen or fourteen, she later rose to the rank of Imperial Consort, bringing the Jia family to the height of its glory. The practice of \"returning home to observe filial piety\" allowed imperial consorts to leave the palace temporarily to visit their parents and elders. To welcome Yuanchun on such an occasion, the Jia family constructed the Grand View Garden.\n\nThe Grand View Garden becomes many things at once: a fleeting paradise where Yuanchun briefly reunites with her family yet remains forever separated from her youth; a secluded world where Baoyu and the young maidens live under the protective shadow of her imperial status; and, ultimately, a lost eden—Cao Xueqin’s elegy for a bygone age of prosperity and tenderness.\n",
