        "name": "Five Dynasties — Yue Ware Secret-Color Celadon Basin",
        "description": "This celadon basin features an outward-flaring rim with a folded edge, a slanted curved wall, deep rounded belly, and a flat base. The center of the underside is slightly concave, and firing marks remain clearly visible along the footring, where the unglazed areas reveal the gray clay body. The piece is covered in a translucent celadon glaze of grayish-green tone. The glaze is thin and evenly applied, with a few pale speckled patches on the outer wall. Before archaeological discoveries in the early Republic of China period clarified kiln attributions, experts from the Qing Court Aftercare Committee mistakenly identified this piece as a Ru ware product and inscribed inside the basin: “One Ru ware flared-rim fruit wash.” This inscription reflects how historical and modern approaches to ceramic connoisseurship may differ. The museum’s Yue ware ‘secret-color’ celadon basin is finely glazed, elegant in form, and closely resembles celadon basins unearthed from Five Dynasties tombs, suggesting it may have been used by members of the upper class during that period.",
