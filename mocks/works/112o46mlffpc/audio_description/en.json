        "description": "This vase features a slightly flared round mouth, a short neck, and a pair of tubular handles attached symmetrically to the shoulders. The body is full and rounded, tapering to a flat base supported by a low ring foot. Two raised string lines encircle the neck. The clay body is thick and substantial, and the entire vessel is coated in a rich celadon glaze. The surface is covered with fine crackle lines in pale brown tones, with occasional tiny pinholes. The edge of the ring foot reveals the unglazed clay body, brushed with an iron-brown slip.",
