Cao Xueqin, author of *Dream of the Red Chamber*, was born into such a distinguished literary family. His grandfather, Cao Yin, excelled in poetry and textual collations, and was commissioned to edit the *Imperially Commissioned Complete Tang Poems*. Beginning with Cao Yin’s grandfather, Cao Xi, the Cao family held—over three generations and four appointments—the prestigious post of Jiangning Imperial Weaving Superintendent. This position, entrusted only to those close to the emperor, was responsible for producing and procuring textiles and items required by the imperial household, including the silk robes for the *Dragon Canon*.\n\nThese unique life experiences profoundly shaped Cao Xueqin. The refined poetry, elegant musical compositions, and exquisite descriptions of objects found throughout *Dream of the Red Chamber* reflect the cultural richness and material sophistication inherited from his family background.",
