        "description": "Among the mingqi figurines buried as tomb objects in the Tang dynasty, the well-known “Tang sancai” is only one category. Even more numerous—and produced over a longer period—were various types of painted earthenware figurines. These figures were typically molded using red or gray clay, refined by hand, fired in a kiln, and then decorated with painted pigments. In the case of this lady figurine, the piece was first shaped and fired in gray clay, then coated with a layer of white slip, on top of which red, green, black, and other pigments were applied. Unfortunately, most of the original vibrant colors have flaked away over time, leaving only faint traces of its once-brilliant appearance. The National Palace Museum holds two Tang painted gray-earthenware lady figurines (the other catalogued as Gift Porcelain 000550), both made in the Chang’an region during the eighth century and offering a glimpse into contemporary life. Noblewomen in mid-eighth-century Chang’an were characterized by full, rounded faces and elaborate hairstyles extending outward like cicada wings. Their figures were plump and graceful. They wore open-collared jackets and long skirts that grazed the ground, with the pointed tips of embroidered shoes peeking out from beneath. Although the skirt is voluminous, the draping folds of the sleeves and the gathered fabric between the feet reveal the soft, rounded form of the body beneath, fully expressing the elegant confidence and majestic beauty associated with women of the High Tang period.",
