        "description": "This compact dressing case assembles a miniature set of personal grooming tools designed for travel and daily refinement. Such cases typically contain a small mirror, glass bottles for perfumes or aromatic powders, and implements such as knives, scissors, and tweezers. The exterior is often lavishly decorated—its panels inlaid with painted enamel plaques, mother-of-pearl, agate, or multicolored gemstones—capturing the opulent aesthetic of eighteenth-century European craftsmanship. Portable yet sumptuous, these cases reflect a world in which elegance accompanied every gesture, even those performed in private.",
