The base is carved into a recessed foot, left unglazed and coated with a yellowish-brown slip for protection. Except for the base, the entire surface is covered in a cobalt-blue glaze. Traces of once-present gold or silver foil decoration can still be faintly seen on the glaze. Below the inner rim is a band of lozenge-patterned squares, while the center of the interior displays a twelve-pointed star rosette. A single branch of plum blossoms encircles the exterior wall.",
