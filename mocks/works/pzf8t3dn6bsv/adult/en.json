Petal-like bands encircle the upper and lower sections of the body. Against a soft pink enamel ground, two oval reserves present charming scenes of playful children, created using transfer-print techniques. Garlanded ribbons further embellish the surface. In its form, enameling style, and finely worked gilt details, the piece reflects the characteristics of English craftsmanship from the latter half of the eighteenth century.",
