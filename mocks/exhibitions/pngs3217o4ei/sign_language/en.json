        "description": "The National Palace Museum carries not only cultural artifacts but also a collective memory that transcends eras. The year 2025 marks several important milestones in the museum’s history: the 100th anniversary since its transformation in 1925 from an imperial collection into a museum shared by the public; the 75th anniversary of the artifacts’ relocation to Taiwan and their preservation in the Beigou repository beginning in 1950; the 60th anniversary since the establishment of the National Palace Museum in Taiwan in 1965; and the 10th anniversary of the Southern Branch, which opened in 2015. At this moment of overlapping centennial and cyclical milestones, the museum presents the special exhibition “Sixty Cycles, Endless Legacy,” reflecting on the achievements of the past sixty years while envisioning the boundless possibilities of the future through a century of accumulated heritage.",

In 1762, on New Year's Eve of the renwu year (the 27th year of the Qianlong reign), he passed away “before reaching the age of fifty, his tears exhausted while the book remained unfinished.” Our understanding of his short life and his incomplete *Dream of the Red Chamber* is often fragmentary, as if his very existence were a riddle.\n\nYet the novel’s unfinished state has never diminished its allure. If anything, its open-endedness inspired generations of readers, giving rise to numerous editions, commentaries, and pictorial interpretations such as this illustrated work.",

Entering the palace at the age of thirteen or fourteen, she later rose to the rank of Imperial Consort, bringing the Jia family to the height of its glory. The practice of \"returning home to observe filial piety\" allowed imperial consorts to leave the palace temporarily to visit their parents and elders. To welcome Yuanchun on such an occasion, the Jia family constructed the Grand View Garden.\n\nThe Grand View Garden becomes many things at once: a fleeting paradise where Yuanchun briefly reunites with her family yet remains forever separated from her youth; a secluded world where Baoyu and the young maidens live under the protective shadow of her imperial status; and, ultimately, a lost eden—Cao Xueqin’s elegy for a bygone age of prosperity and tenderness.\n",

For Cao Xueqin, such elegance was embedded in memory: exquisite antique ceramics, alongside Qing-period archaistic wares, form the backdrop of the world he reimagined.\n\nRu ware—“as precious as the morning star”—appears repeatedly in the novel in the form of dishes, vases, and flower vessels. Ding ware—“the finest white under heaven”—is likewise present: at Baoyu’s birthday banquet, forty Ding ware dishes are used to serve delicacies and seasonal fruits.

These refined objects embellish both the Jia household and the Grand View Garden. For Cao Xueqin, such elegance was embedded in memory: exquisite antique ceramics, alongside Qing-period archaistic wares, form the backdrop of the world he reimagined.\n\nRu ware—“as precious as the morning star”—appears repeatedly in the novel in the form of dishes, vases, and flower vessels. Ding ware—“the finest white under heaven”—is likewise present: at Baoyu’s birthday banquet, forty Ding ware dishes are used to serve delicacies and seasonal fruits. Quietly luxurious yet understated, these porcelains leave a lasting impression of the refined daily life they once adorned.",
