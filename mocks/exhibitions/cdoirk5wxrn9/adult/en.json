        "description": "Ceramics are a symbol of civilization. From stone processing and clay preparation, wheel throwing and shaping, glazing and decorating, to firing in the kiln, soft clay transforms into hard ceramics—like a material undergoing metamorphosis. The cultural factors behind each piece give rise to diverse forms, glaze colors, and decorative motifs. Emperors, supervisors, artisans, and users together shaped the style of each era. What makes ceramics captivating is how they resonate with long-standing historical narratives while simultaneously reflecting cultural exchange through the networks of ceramic production.",

Even more numerous—and produced over a longer period—were various types of painted earthenware figurines. These figures were typically molded using red or gray clay, refined by hand, fired in a kiln, and then decorated with painted pigments. In the case of this lady figurine, the piece was first shaped and fired in gray clay, then coated with a layer of white slip, on top of which red, green, black, and other pigments were applied. Unfortunately, most of the original vibrant colors have flaked away over time, leaving only faint traces of its once-brilliant appearance. The National Palace Museum holds two Tang painted gray-earthenware lady figurines (the other catalogued as Gift Porcelain 000550), both made in the Chang’an region during the eighth century and offering a glimpse into contemporary life. Noblewomen in mid-eighth-century Chang’an were characterized by full, rounded faces and elaborate hairstyles extending outward like cicada wings. Their figures were plump and graceful. They wore open-collared jackets and long skirts that grazed the ground, with the pointed tips of embroidered shoes peeking out from beneath. Although the skirt is voluminous, the draping folds of the sleeves and the gathered fabric between the feet reveal the soft, rounded form of the body beneath, fully expressing the elegant confidence and majestic beauty associated with women of the High Tang period.",

The exterior walls and base are covered in a glossy white glaze, with pooled areas showing a slight bluish tint reminiscent of lake water. The glaze inside the vessel covers less than half, revealing the grayish-white clay body beneath. The vessel features a flared round mouth, short neck, ring foot, and a long cylindrical body with slightly indented sides. Pairs of strap loops are attached to the upper and lower sections, allowing cords to pass through—much like flasks carried on horseback. During the Tang dynasty, objects made from different materials often imitated one another. Another example in the museum’s collection is a white-glazed molded cup with fish motifs, shaped like a four-petaled flower, which derives from the multi-lobed metal drinking cups of the Sasanian tradition.",

The exterior walls and base are covered in a glossy white glaze, with pooled areas showing a slight bluish tint reminiscent of lake water. The glaze inside the vessel covers less than half, revealing the grayish-white clay body beneath. The vessel features a flared round mouth, short neck, ring foot, and a long cylindrical body with slightly indented sides. Pairs of strap loops are attached to the upper and lower sections, allowing cords to pass through—much like flasks carried on horseback. During the Tang dynasty, objects made from different materials often imitated one another. Another example in the museum’s collection is a white-glazed molded cup with fish motifs, shaped like a four-petaled flower, which derives from the multi-lobed metal drinking cups of the Sasanian tradition.",

                "description": "This white-glazed ceramic pillow shaped as a reclining infant exemplifies the refined modeling and decorative techniques of Ding ware. Ding kilns primarily produced white porcelains noted for their precise craftsmanship, smooth and lustrous glaze, and ivory-tinged color. Decorative methods included shallow carving, deep engraving, and molded designs. On this pillow, the creamy white glaze appears warm and mellow. The head and body were each formed in two joined halves, assembled together, and then finely carved to define the facial features. Various decorative techniques were skillfully combined: the floral motifs along the hem of the long garment, the spherical patterns on the vest, and the cloud-and-chilong designs on the platform are all rendered through molding, while the peony scrolls on the back are carved. The molded patterns are crisp, and the carved lines flow naturally, achieving a harmonious balance. On the underside is an imperial poem composed by the Qianlong Emperor, in which he likens such pillows to ‘warning pillows’—objects reminding him to remain diligent. When read together with other imperial poems on Ding ware child pillows, it also reveals his wish, like King Wu Ding in ancient times, to find virtuous ministers through dreams. Only three surviving examples of this baby-pillow form are known today, two housed in this museum and the third in the Palace Museum, Beijing.",

                                "transcript": "This white-glazed ceramic pillow shaped as a reclining infant exemplifies the refined modeling and decorative techniques of Ding ware. Ding kilns primarily produced white porcelains noted for their precise craftsmanship, smooth and lustrous glaze, and ivory-tinged color. Decorative methods included shallow carving, deep engraving, and molded designs. On this pillow, the creamy white glaze appears warm and mellow. The head and body were each formed in two joined halves, assembled together, and then finely carved to define the facial features. Various decorative techniques were skillfully combined: the floral motifs along the hem of the long garment, the spherical patterns on the vest, and the cloud-and-chilong designs on the platform are all rendered through molding, while the peony scrolls on the back are carved. The molded patterns are crisp, and the carved lines flow naturally, achieving a harmonious balance. On the underside is an imperial poem composed by the Qianlong Emperor, in which he likens such pillows to ‘warning pillows’—objects reminding him to remain diligent. When read together with other imperial poems on Ding ware child pillows, it also reveals his wish, like King Wu Ding in ancient times, to find virtuous ministers through dreams. Only three surviving examples of this baby-pillow form are known today, two housed in this museum and the third in the Palace Museum, Beijing.",

The form is stately and balanced, with a rich bluish-green glaze characteristic of Guan ware. The dense network of crackles appears in layered patterns, while the shape itself derives from earlier Northern Song forms seen in Ru and Ding ware zun vessels with string-pattern bands. The broad and flat base bears twelve large spur marks revealing the dark gray clay body beneath. The exterior wall is decorated with three tiers of string patterns, each composed of three horizontal raised lines. The entire piece is coated in a thick, lustrous pale blue glaze. Where the glaze pools and thins around the ridges, the string-pattern relief appears slightly darkened in brownish tones. Along the rim, the thinner glaze reveals subtle reddish-brown hues. The surface is covered in intricate, ice-crackle patterns. Similar fragments have been unearthed at the Jiaotanxia and Laohudong Guan kiln sites in Hangzhou, Zhejiang.",

The form is stately and balanced, with a rich bluish-green glaze characteristic of Guan ware. The dense network of crackles appears in layered patterns, while the shape itself derives from earlier Northern Song forms seen in Ru and Ding ware zun vessels with string-pattern bands. The broad and flat base bears twelve large spur marks revealing the dark gray clay body beneath. The exterior wall is decorated with three tiers of string patterns, each composed of three horizontal raised lines. The entire piece is coated in a thick, lustrous pale blue glaze. Where the glaze pools and thins around the ridges, the string-pattern relief appears slightly darkened in brownish tones. Along the rim, the thinner glaze reveals subtle reddish-brown hues. The surface is covered in intricate, ice-crackle patterns. Similar fragments have been unearthed at the Jiaotanxia and Laohudong Guan kiln sites in Hangzhou, Zhejiang.",

                "description": "This tea bowl features a contracted rim with a gently inward-curving lip, deep rounded walls, and a small ring foot. The glaze does not extend to the base, leaving the thick, coarse, dark brown clay exposed. The exterior of the foot is unglazed, while the recessed inner foot bears an incised character, 律 (“lü”), in regular script. The glaze is a dense, flowing jet-black that drips down the outer wall near the foot and pools thickly at the interior center. Around the rim, the thinner glaze forms the characteristic warm brown “hare’s fur mouth.” Both the interior and exterior surfaces display fine streaks of blue-yellow crystalline patterns created during firing. These streaks flow with the glaze, interweaving in rich layers reminiscent of the glossy fur of an autumn hare—hence the name “hare’s fur bowl,” as used in the Song dynasty.",

Phoenix-shaped handles are applied to both sides of the neck, giving the piece an elegant and dignified silhouette. It is one of the representative works of the Longquan kilns during the Southern Song dynasty. Located in southern Zhejiang, Longquan was a vast ceramic-production region known for its diverse output. After the Southern Song period, it became a major supplier of ceramics both domestically and internationally, with its wares frequently discovered in Song and Yuan tombs, hoards, and archaeological sites along overseas trade routes. The long-necked, dish-lipped vase type was first produced by the Northern Song Ru kilns and later adopted by Southern Song official kilns, becoming a favored form among imperial ceramics. Longquan potters then introduced variations by adding fish- or phoenix-shaped handles. On this vase, the phoenix handles are crisply molded, with clearly defined heads and feathers. The glaze is a luminous powder-green celadon, smooth, even, and free of flaws. It closely resembles the celebrated Longquan phoenix-ear vases preserved in Japan, inscribed by imperial decree with the names “Senshō” and “Banshō,” and ranks among the finest examples of Longquan ware.",

Phoenix-shaped handles are applied to both sides of the neck, giving the piece an elegant and dignified silhouette. It is one of the representative works of the Longquan kilns during the Southern Song dynasty. Located in southern Zhejiang, Longquan was a vast ceramic-production region known for its diverse output. After the Southern Song period, it became a major supplier of ceramics both domestically and internationally, with its wares frequently discovered in Song and Yuan tombs, hoards, and archaeological sites along overseas trade routes. The long-necked, dish-lipped vase type was first produced by the Northern Song Ru kilns and later adopted by Southern Song official kilns, becoming a favored form among imperial ceramics. Longquan potters then introduced variations by adding fish- or phoenix-shaped handles. On this vase, the phoenix handles are crisply molded, with clearly defined heads and feathers. The glaze is a luminous powder-green celadon, smooth, even, and free of flaws. It closely resembles the celebrated Longquan phoenix-ear vases preserved in Japan, inscribed by imperial decree with the names “Senshō” and “Banshō,” and ranks among the finest examples of Longquan ware.",
