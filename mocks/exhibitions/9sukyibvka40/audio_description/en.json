                "description": "This luminous sugar bowl—its white glaze adorned with delicate gold decoration—bears traces of a long and distinguished journey. On its underside remain both the Sèvres factory marks and an original retail label, preserving the story of how it was made, sold, and eventually carried across continents.\n\nAt the center of its marks is the pair of crossed “L”s, the emblem used by the Sèvres manufactory in honor of the French kings Louis XIV and Louis XV. Inside the intertwined letters appears a small double “f,” a date letter indicating the year of manufacture. By comparing this mark to factory records, the bowl can be firmly dated to 1783—placing it within the reign of Louis XV, as the crossed “L”s here suggest.\n\nIn its early years Sèvres could produce only soft-paste porcelain, but by the 1770s the factory had finally mastered hard-paste—considered in Europe the equal of prized Chinese porcelain. The gilded crown painted above the mark is the factory’s proud signifier of true hard-paste ware. The initials “LF” at the bottom identify the decorator, the skilled painter La France, who in the spring of 1783 embellished not only this bowl but also matching teapots, milk jugs, and cups with the same refined motifs.\n\nDuring the latter half of the eighteenth century, Sèvres was overseen by France’s prime minister, Henry Leonard Jean-Baptiste Bertin, a statesman deeply fascinated by distant China. Hoping to express goodwill toward the Qianlong Emperor, Bertin purchased this sugar bowl for 18 livres and arranged for it to be delivered across great distance to the Qing court. The surviving retail label—still legible today—quietly preserves this once-forgotten story of diplomacy, craftsmanship, and the global travels of a single porcelain piece.",

On its underside remain both the Sèvres factory marks and an original retail label, preserving the story of how it was made, sold, and eventually carried across continents.\n\nAt the center of its marks is the pair of crossed “L”s, the emblem used by the Sèvres manufactory in honor of the French kings Louis XIV and Louis XV. Inside the intertwined letters appears a small double “f,” a date letter indicating the year of manufacture. By comparing this mark to factory records, the bowl can be firmly dated to 1783—placing it within the reign of Louis XV, as the crossed “L”s here suggest.\n\nIn its early years Sèvres could produce only soft-paste porcelain, but by the 1770s the factory had finally mastered hard-paste—considered in Europe the equal of prized Chinese porcelain. The gilded crown painted above the mark is the factory’s proud signifier of true hard-paste ware. The initials “LF” at the bottom identify the decorator, the skilled painter La France, who in the spring of 1783 embellished not only this bowl but also matching teapots, milk jugs, and cups with the same refined motifs.\n\nDuring the latter half of the eighteenth century, Sèvres was overseen by France’s prime minister, Henry Leonard Jean-Baptiste Bertin, a statesman deeply fascinated by distant China. Hoping to express goodwill toward the Qianlong Emperor, Bertin purchased this sugar bowl for 18 livres and arranged for it to be delivered across great distance to the Qing court. The surviving retail label—still legible today—quietly preserves this once-forgotten story of diplomacy, craftsmanship, and the global travels of a single porcelain piece.",

Such cases typically contain a small mirror, glass bottles for perfumes or aromatic powders, and implements such as knives, scissors, and tweezers. The exterior is often lavishly decorated—its panels inlaid with painted enamel plaques, mother-of-pearl, agate, or multicolored gemstones—capturing the opulent aesthetic of eighteenth-century European craftsmanship. Portable yet sumptuous, these cases reflect a world in which elegance accompanied every gesture, even those performed in private.",
